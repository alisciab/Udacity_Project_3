# Analyze A/B Test Results
## by Aliscia Boyd


## Dataset: E-commerce website user data provided by Udacity

> For this project, I work to understand the results of an A/B test run by an (imaginary) e-commerce website.  My goal was to help the company understand if they should implement a new website page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.


## Summary of Findings

Out of three statistical analysis methods applied to the data, only one showed that the new page should be adopted. Overall, the analysis performed in this project did NOT support the implementation of the new page.


## Key Insights

> Probability analysis DID NOT support the new page implementation (~12% conversion rate).

> A/B Test analysis DID support the new page implementation (~90% conversion rate).

> Regression analysis DID NOT support the new page implementation (~12% conversion rate).
